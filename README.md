# Directed-Weighted-Graph-py

This project base on directed weighted graph and including algorithms for finding the shortest path from node to node (based on Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm).\
This Python project, also contains comparisons between this graph, and a Java project that also contains a graph. In addition, there is a comparison to the NetworkX module.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Java JDK-15

### Installing
- Clone that project to your workspace directory:\
`
git clone https://github.com/hodefiDavid/Directed-Weighted-Graph-py.git
`
- Open the directory and make sure you see the project

### Running the main
- Go to src directory: \
  `cd Directed-Weighted-Graph-py` \
  `cd src`
- Run the main: \
  `py -m Ex3_main`

  
### The main class in the project:
- DiGraph (extend GraphInterface): directed weighted graph DS.
- GraphAlgo (extend GraphAlgoInterface): algorithms on DiGraph.
