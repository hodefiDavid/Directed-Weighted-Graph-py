# Directed-Weighted-Graph-py

This project base on directed weighted graph and including algorithms for finding the shortest path from node to node (based on Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm).\
This Python project, also contains comparisons between this graph, and a Java project that also contains a graph. In addition, there is a comparison to the NetworkX module.

Java JDK-15

### Installing
- Clone that project to your workspace directory:\
`
git clone https://github.com/hodefiDavid/Directed-Weighted-Graph-py.git
`
- Open the directory and make sure you see the project

### Running the main
- Run Ex2.jar, or from CMD you can run it with args:\
  `java  -jar Ex2.jar <id, level>`
